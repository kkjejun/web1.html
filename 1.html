<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
is an information system where documents and other web
resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
(URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked
by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.
[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed
by users by a software application called a web browser and
are published by a software application called a web server.
The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades
and upon whose technologies the Web is built.
